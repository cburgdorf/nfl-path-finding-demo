# NFL Pathfinding Demo

A tiny TypeScript web demo that overlays a coarse grid on `assets/map.png` and classifies each tile as water (`0`) or land (`1`). Overlay and labels can be toggled; numbers are derived from the map image.

## Getting started

1) Install dependencies: `npm install`
2) Build TypeScript once: `npm run build` (or use `npm run watch` while editing)
3) Serve locally: `npm run start` and open http://localhost:4173

The dev server is a lightweight Node script with no extra dependencies. Generated files live in `dist/` and are ignored by git.
